Hello, 

My name is James J. King and I want to believe I am a junior web developer, but a hobbiest is more fitting. I have been working on an e-commerce/ social media platform for animal products as well as breed specific content. 

I have been educating myself with Udemy and freecodecamp.com, which both have been tremendously useful in my pursuit to gaining my Masters in CS. Still a lot of work to go! 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on dorabledora.com
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, React, PHP, wordpress, mySQL, Python, MERN(serverless)...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on challenges and junior development tips to excel 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with process and procedures that will guide junior developers to adapt with experienced developers
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything really, I would love to answer questions or help with projects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jamesjking026@gmail.com or Discord (James_King#0641)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Worked in a hospital for 6.5 years as a CNA, moved to South Korea for 4.5 years, Business Major ðŸ¤£, love to camp and watch anime!
